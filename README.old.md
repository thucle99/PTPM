## ReactJS Programming Test 2021

### Preface
We’re building an awesome product which uses ReactJS as one of the main client-side technologies. Thus, we
need to know more about your knowledge & experience with ReactJS. We want to request you to take a small
Programming Test in order to measure:
- Your proficiency in ReactJS
- Your extensive knowledge of CSS, JS, HTML & other client-side topics
- Your problem-solving skills
Please demonstrate your excellent skills to provide us a demo that solves the following problem:

### Problem
We want to build a Gallery MODAL which will show a list of images that users uploaded to the system, some
might already have mỏe than 100 images. Thus, we want to implement infinite scrolling to that list.

In the demo, by default, only 25 items will be shown.When user scrolls to the bottom of the list, additional 25
items will be added & so on..., until 105 items are fully loaded.

User MUST login before seeing this page.

## Requirements
Your demo will have to meet these requirements:

### Dependencies
Use all the the following packages as dependencies:

- webpack@4
- react-semantic-ui as main UI framework or any UI framework
- react@16

Test environment
We will test your results in an environment which installs:

- node@&14
- yarn@1.19.1
- Chromium Edge
And expect to run it by:
- Run command yarn install from root directory to install the dependencies
- Run command yarn start to start server
- Open localhost:@{PROVIDED_PORT} in Chrome / Edge

## Plus points
You’re free to use any technologies that have not been listed in Requirements section. But the items below will
be considered as Plus points:

### Adaptive design
